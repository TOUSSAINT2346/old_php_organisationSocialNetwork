## 💬 About the Project

When I started my bachelor's in **International Relations** in 2014, I created a group with my new colleagues called **"_Mi Mafia_"**.  
We were a lively bunch, passionate about politics, debate, and socialising. So I decided to build us our own **social network**:  
👉 *Mi Mafia, tu mafia.*

This system became our **private online hub**, where we could elect our "_Capo_" (leader), publish news, propose projects, and programme events, all within our own playful *mafia-inspired* structure.

## 🚀 Why I Keep It Here

This project marks the **beginning of my journey as a developer** — where creativity, humour, and a touch of political flair met code.  
It's a nostalgic example of how even small, student-driven communities can inspire full digital ecosystems.

## 🎩 Fun Facts

- The Capo was **elected democratically every month** — complete with campaigns and all! 🗳️  
- Some users actually **wrote columns** for *O Diário Mafioso*, treating it like a real newsroom.  
- “Mi Mafia” even issued **plebiscites** to decide who could join (or be expelled from!) our group. Bureaucracy meets friendship! 🇮🇹
